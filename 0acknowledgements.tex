\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

First, I would like to thank my supervisor, professor Petri Vuorimaa, for the valuable guidance regarding the whole thesis process: selecting and refining the subject, scheduling and advice related to both substance and form. I would also like to thank my instructor, D.Sc. Sami Vihavainen, who was an inspiring, supportive and insightful mentor for me. Without them, this thesis would not be finished.

I would like to thank my employer Futurice and my wonderful colleagues for giving me the freedom to work with, and complete control over, this thesis. I would also like to express my gratitude to my family for support throughout my studies. Lastly, I would like to thank my fianc√©e Pia for providing me motivation and a reason to complete this work.
