suffice.

\fixme{Here maybe something related to why I chose this topic, i.e. why it is beneficial for me/others to have a framework that eases the map visualization process.}

Geographical data is data with geospatial dimension, such as POI with location data as coordinates. The most natural method for visualizing geographical data is usually with various maps. In the past, geographical data was predominantly visualized by cartographers, but it has been recognized \citep{kraak_visualization_1999} that the situation has changed, with people from increasing number of fields having a need for visualizing geographical data. Moreover, the popularity of Google Maps \citep{google_maps_2005} along with its API \citep{google_maps_2005-1} has proved that in addition to experts of other academic fields, there is a definite demand for web map visualizations within consumers as well. 

The web makes publishing and bundling map visualizations extraordinarily straightforward when compared to traditional desktop-based GIS applications, which is especially important when the visualizations are made by non-cartographers \fixme{find a reference for this maybe}. However, as the web platform is designed for static documents instead of dynamic applications \citep{berners-lee_information_1989,berners-lee_world-wide_1992}, there are some additional concerns to address when making a complex data visualization on the web.

\fixme{Why geodata should be visualized? \citet[chap.~1.1]{kraak_cartography_2011} should help.}

\section{Problem statement}

Currently, there are several libraries available for displaying maps and simple visualizations \fixme{add references to the libraries. GMaps, Leaflet, OpenLayers etc.}. However, none of the mainstream libraries is of sufficiently high abstraction level for building map visualizations effectively, resulting in the need for writing \emph{boilerplate} code that does not directly contribute to the visualization.

We plan to evaluate means to make creating map visualizations for the web more efficient by building a higher abstraction level software framework for map visualizations. This framework should provide the structure for creating the visualization as well as common web application features needed in modern web applications.

In order to find the solution for the problem, it is necessary to study geographical visualizations and software frameworks. The process of making geographical visualizations should be studied to ensure that the framework enables creating \emph{effective} visualizations. In addition, software frameworks and software reuse should be studied in order to be able to create visualizations \emph{efficiently}. Therefore, we select the following research questions for this thesis:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item[RQ1] How to measure software framework efficiency reliably?
	\item[RQ2] How to build a software framework which enables creating effective geographical visualizations efficiently?
\end{enumerate}

\section{Structure of the Thesis}
\label{section:structure} 

Chapter 1 (this introduction) presents the motivation for this thesis as well as the problem statement. Chapter 2 describes the background of the work. In particular, the chapter describes how to visualize geographical data and the essence of web software frameworks. Chapter 3 presents the web technology, standards and other needed material for building a web visualization as well as describing some existing map visualizations \fixme{Maybe rephrase}.

In chapter 4, we discuss the methods used to examine the problem and evaluate solutions we will propose. In chapter 5, we describe the methods used to solve the problem. In chapter 6, we evaluate the implementation and its results. \fixme{Chapters 7 and 8 missing. Also, maybe elaborate description about chapters 4-6 a bit}
