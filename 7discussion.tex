\chapter{Discussion}
\label{chapter:discussion}

At this point, you will have some insightful thoughts on your implementation
and you may have ideas on what could be done in the future. 
This chapter is a good place to discuss your thesis as a whole and to show your
professor that you have really understood some non-trivial aspects of the
methods you used\ldots

\fixme{Stuff to discuss}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Different evaluation methods yield different results (should the framework be included in calculations? how?) What measurements are used? Etc.
	\item The nature of cases picked for evaluation affects the results considerably - e.g. choosing really similar cases yields more positive results, really different cases yield more negative results - a note from one of the reuse sources that mention reuse evaluation being really hard
	\item Framework is be reusable - how is that taken into account when calculating results (can be used in the future infinity times)
	\item Framework likely affects other properties of visualizations - quality, maintainability etc. These could be studied in the future.
\end{itemize}
