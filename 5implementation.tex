You have now explained how you are going to tackle your problem. 
Go do that now! Come back when the problem is solved!

Now, how did you solve the problem? 
Explain how you implemented your solution, be it a software component, a
custom-made FPGA, a fried jelly bean, or whatever.
Describe the problems you encountered with your implementation work.


\begin{itemize}
	\item First, analyze several visualizations made separately
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Plain map => Peruskartta
		\item Dot map => FindBooze
		\item Isarithmic map => Travel time visualization (to do)
		\item Heatmap => Helsinki Hot?
		\item Choropleth map => Use some existing?
		\item Proportional symbol map => to do
		\item Flow map => any way to find anything relevant?
	\end{itemize}
	\item Consider multivariate possibilities
	\item Try to find common elements and patterns => use these as a basis for framework implementation
	\item Need to build visualizations efficiently => some kind of whole page scaffold needed
	\item Need to be able to embed visualizations => container-specific solution needed
\end{itemize}
