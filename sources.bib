	abstract = {Descartes (formerly called {IRIS}) is a software system designed to support visual exploration of spatially referenced data, e.g. demographic, economical, or cultural information about geographical objects or locations such as countries, districts, or cities. Descartes offers two integrated services: automated presentation of data on maps, and facilities to interactively manipulate these maps. Automated mapping is enabled by incorporating generic knowledge on map design into the system. Descartes selects suitable presentation methods according to characteristics of the variables to be analysed and relationships among those variables if more than one were selected simultaneously. The cartographic knowledge of Descartes allows non-cartographers to receive proper presentations of their data, and the automation of map construction helps the users to save valuable time that can better be used for data analysis and problem-solving. Exploratory data analysis requires highly interactive, dynamic data displays. We strive to develop various interactive techniques for map manipulation that could enhance the expressiveness of maps and thus promote data exploration. We are convinced that a technique can be made especially productive if it is directed towards a particular presentation method: it can utilise peculiarities of this method and support those analytical operations that best fit to the method.},

Research approach -- Eighty seven students, divided into three experimental conditions, rated their preference for two different graphs displaying identical information - a standard bar-graph and a minimalist version. Both versions were taken from Tufte (1983). Findings/Design -- The results indicate a clear preference of non-minimalist bar-graphs, suggesting low acceptance of minimalist design principles such as high data-ink ratio. Research limitations/Implications -- Subjects had no prior experience with the minimalist graph and therefore familiarity might have an effect on the results. Originality/Value -- The research contributes empirical results on people's preferences to the mostly theoretical/ideological debate over approaches to the presentation of quantitative information. Take away message -- People did not like Tufte's minimalist design of bar-graphs; they seem to prefer "chartjunk" instead.},

The cartographic visualization process is changing: changing from being supply-driven to demand-driven. More people will be involved in making maps. More maps will be created, many of them only for a single purpose. These maps are changing from being final products presenting spatial information to interim products that facilitate our visual thinking. These changes require a different type of cartographer, someone who is an integral part in the process of spatial data handling. As well as traditional cartographic design skills, cartographers must make their knowledge available to fellow geoscientists using interactive real-time maps to solve their problems. A challenge for cartographers is to create or improve mapping tools that allow exploration.},

Such systems represent more sophisticated, time and cost effective tools than traditional field forms for data acquisition. Meanwhile, various systems are on the market.

The digital acquisition of application specific attributes is often underrepresented within such systems. This is surprising because pen computer based {GIS} can be used to collect attributes in a profitable manner, thus adequately supporting the requirements of the user. Visualization and graphic displays of spatial data are helpful means to improve such a data collection process.
In section one and two basic aspects of visualization and current uses of visualization techniques for field based {GIS} are described. Section three mentions new developments within the framework of wearable computing and augmented reality. Section four describes current activities aimed at the realization of real time online field based {GIS}.

Reusing existing software components is a key feature in increasing software productivity. It is one of the key elements in object-oriented programming, which reduces the cost and increases the quality of the software. An important feature of C++ called templates support generic programming, which allows the programmer to develop reusable software modules such as functions, classes, etc. The need for software reusability metrics is particularly acute for an organization in order to measure the degree of generic programming included in the form of templates in code. This research addresses this need and introduces a new set of metrics for object-oriented software. Two metrics are proposed for measuring amount of genericty included in the code and then analytically evaluated against Weyuker's set of nine axioms. This set of metrics is then applied to standard projects and accordingly ways in which project managers can use these metrics are suggested.},

	abstract = {Recent years have witnessed rapid advances in online map-based mashups with Application Programming Interfaces ({APIs}) and web services. Map-based mashups often display different kinds of information (e.g., {POIs}, represented as icons) on base maps, such as Google Maps and Bing Maps. The visualization of large number of icons in a map on web browsers or mobile devices often results in the icon cluttering problem with icons touching and overlapping each other. This problem decreases map legibility, and thus prevents users from effectively processing the information presented in the map. It also leads to a dramatic degradation of performance, and a high transmission load. All these problems will greatly decrease the usability of a mashup application. This paper surveys and assesses approaches from different disciplines (i.e., computer science and cartography) for avoiding icon cluttering in online map-based mashups. We focus on two issues: filtering of irrelevant {POIs}, and icon placement and aggregation. Different techniques from information filtering research are analyzed and compared for reducing the number of icons to be displayed in a map. For the latter issue, approaches of aggregating and placing icons from map generalization research are discussed and assessed for their applicability in online mashups. Some related {APIs} and typical mashup examples are also discussed and compared. This paper concludes that in order to provide more cartographically pleasing maps in mashups, techniques from computer science and cartography should be seamlessly integrated.},

	abstract = {Data stories {\textendash} this buzzword links together two different disciplines: computer science and journalism. The new relationship is called data-driven journalism. The emerging product of this relationship: data-based visualization that reveals the story behind the data. However, who produces those "data stories"? A journalist, an information designer, a computer scientist, or a team? New formats often implicate new workflows and a new way of thinking. This paper sets data visualization in the context of online journalism by focusing on the production process. We interviewed 19 experts of German, Swiss, and American media companies: designers, programmers, and journalists. For the analysis of the interviews we used the grounded theory approach. The findings show: The crucial success factor in the production process of data-based visualization in journalism is the attitude that everyone in the team acts as a journalist {\textendash} no matter whether programmer, designer or statistician. A case study of the New York Times newsroom illustrates our findings.},

	abstract = {The visualization of spatial information in the form of maps is a critical task to facilitate decision making in environmental management. Web Map Services ({WMS}), Styled Layer Descriptor ({SLD}) and Symbology Encoding ({SE}) already created an open framework for Web mapping services. However, from the cartographic point of view, the {OGC} standards have several limitations for producing high quality cartographic representations. Fortunately, these standards can be cartographically enriched to fulfil the complex visualization requirements coming from environmental management. A solution to creating cartographic visualizations based on open standards was developed in the frame of two major European projects, namely {ORCHESTRA} (Open Architecture and Spatial Data Infrastructure for Risk Management) and {SANY} (Sensors Anywhere). For example, the {IST} - 6th Framework Integrated Project {SANY}, focuses on interoperability of in situ sensors and sensor networks. In this context, sensors serve as an extreme illustration for the dynamic nature of spatial information that must be represented in the form of maps. The cartographic extensions for the Symbology Encoding ({SE}) standards allow expressing cartographic rules with spatial operators and advanced feature filtering for layer masking, flexible point symbolization, and patterns and gradients for all spatial features. Furthermore the critical point of creating thematic maps is also solved with extensions for intuitive choropleth and various diagram types generation.},

	abstract = {We provide a research agenda for the International Cartographic Association's Commission on Visualization and Virtual Environment Working Group on Cognitive and Usability Issues in Geovisualization. Developments in hardware and software have led to (and will continue to stimulate) numerous novel methods for visualizing geospatial data. It is our belief that these novel methods will be of little use if they are not developed within a theoretical cognitive framework and iteratively tested using usability engineering principles. We argue that cognitive and usability issues should be considered in the context of six major research themes: 1) geospatial virtual environments ({GeoVEs}); 2) dynamic representations (including animated and interactive maps); 3) metaphors and schemata in user interface design; 4) individual and group differences; 5) collaborative geovisualization; and 6) evaluating the effectiveness of geovisualization methods. A key point underlying our use of theoretical cognitive principles is that traditional cognitive theory for static two-dimensional maps may not be applicable to interactive three-dimensional immersive {GeoVEs} and dynamic representations{\textemdash}thus new cognitive theory may need to be developed. Usability engineering extends beyond the traditional cartographic practice of "user testing" by evaluating software effectiveness throughout a lifecycle (including design, development, and deployment). Applying usability engineering to geovisualization, however, may be problematic because of the novelty of geovisualization and the associated difficulty of defining the nature of users and their tasks. Tackling the research themes is likely to require an interdisciplinary effort involving geographic information scientists, cognitive scientists, usability engineers, computer scientists, and others.},

	abstract = {Cloning in software systems is known to create problems during software maintenance. Several techniques have been proposed to detect the same or similar code fragments in software, so-called simple clones. While the knowledge of simple clones is useful, detecting design-level similarities in software could ease maintenance even further, and also help us identify reuse opportunities. We observed that recurring patterns of simple clones - so-called structural clones - often indicate the presence of interesting design-level similarities. An example would be patterns of collaborating classes or components. Finding structural clones that signify potentially useful design information requires efficient techniques to analyze the bulk of simple clone data and making non-trivial inferences based on the abstracted information. In this paper, we describe a practical solution to the problem of detecting some basic, but useful, types of design-level similarities such as groups of highly similar classes or files. First, we detect simple clones by applying conventional token-based techniques. Then we find the patterns of co-occurring clones in different files using the Frequent Itemset Mining ({FIM}) technique. Finally, we perform file clustering to detect those clusters of highly similar files that are likely to contribute to a design-level similarity pattern. The novelty of our approach is application of data mining techniques to detect design level similarities. Experiments confirmed that our method finds many useful structural clones and scales up to big programs. The paper describes our method for structural clone detection, a prototype tool called Clone Miner that implements the method and experimental results.},

	abstract = {Software reuse is the process of creating software systems from existing software rather than building software systems from scratch. This simple yet powerful vision was introduced in 1968. Software reuse has, however, failed to become a standard software engineering practice. In an attempt to understand why, researchers have renewed their interest in software reuse and in the obstacles to implementing it.
This paper surveys the different approaches to software reuse found in the research literature. It uses a taxonomy to describe and compare the different approaches and make generalizations about the field of software reuse. The taxonomy characterizes each reuse approach in terms of its reusable artifacts and the way these artifacts are  abstracted, selected, specialized, and integrated.
Abstraction plays a central role in software reuse. Concise and expressive abstractions are essential if software artifacts are to be effectively reused. The effectiveness of a reuse technique can be evaluated in terms of cognitive distance{\textemdash}an intuitive gauge of the intellectual effort required to use the technique. Cognitive distance is reduced in two ways: (1) Higher level abstractions in a reuse technique reduce the effort required to go from the initial concept of a software system to representations in the reuse technique, and (2) automation reduces the effort required to go from abstractions in a reuse technique to an executable implementation.
This  survey  will help answer the following questions: What is software reuse? Why reuse software? What are the different approaches to reusing software? How effective are the different approaches? What is required to implement a software reuse technology? Why is software reuse difficult? What are the open areas for research in software reuse?},

Reports of successful software reuse programs in industry have been published. However, there has been little effort to organize the evidence systematically and appraise it. This review aims to assess the effects of software reuse in industrial contexts. Journals and major conferences between 1994 and 2005 were searched to find observational studies and experiments conducted in industry, returning eleven papers of observational type. Systematic software reuse is significantly related to lower problem (defect, fault or error) density in five studies and to decreased effort spent on correcting problems in three studies. The review found evidence for significant gains in apparent productivity in three studies. Other significant benefits of software reuse were reported in single studies or the results were inconsistent. Evidence from industry is sparse and combining results was done by vote-counting. Researchers should pay more attention to using comparable metrics, performing longitudinal studies, and explaining the results and impact on industry. For industry, evaluating reuse of {COTS} or {OSS} components, integrating reuse activities in software processes, better data collection and evaluating return on investment are major challenges.},

Map modelling and visualisation components are sequentially ordered in a process chain which facilitates an automated production workflow. Interaction between web-service players (communicators) is based on a three-tier architecture. Tasks assigned to {CS} essential services are discussed and exemplified for one common application scenario: {CS} as map configurator. Presently, full implementation of {CS} is under way.

In contrast, cognitive science addresses schematisation as a method to intentionally emphasize certain aspects of knowledge beyond technical necessity; therefore, the notion of schematic map is proposed to denote maps that employ schematisation for cognitive representational reasons. This chapter discusses different views of schematisation from cartography, linguistics, and artificial intelligence. Connections to qualitative reasoning in artificial intelligence are drawn. We address human spatial cognition and present examples of task-oriented representations. Finally, multimodality for conveying spatial knowledge and its application in schematic maps are discussed.},

	abstract = {A fundamental distinction between "reference" and "thematic" mapping is common in cartography, but existing analytical literature on the nature of this distinction does not make completely clear why such verbal emphasis on two classes of mapping has emerged, nor exactly what the differentiating criteria are. In this article, emphasis shifts from the map itself to the meaning of the map for the percipient. Using this point of view, a fundamental (and hierarchical) reference/thematic distinction is proposed. The meaning of reference maps originates in direct locational experience{\textemdash}the act of pointing to places as objects, "here is {\textellipsis}". Thematic maps, in contrast, deal with the intellectual construct of space, with knowledge about space rather than experience in space.},

We analyzed similarities and differences among four {RPGs}. By applying a reuse technique of {XVCL}, we built an {RPG} product line architecture ({RPG}-{PLA}) from which we could derive any of the four {RPGs}. We built into the {RPG}-{PLA} a number of performance optimization strategies that could benefit any of the four (and possibly other similar) {RPGs}. By comparing the original vs. the new {RPGs} derived from the {RPG}-{PLA}, we demonstrated that reuse allowed us to achieve improved performance, both speed and memory utilization, as compared to each game developed individually. At the same time, our solution facilitated rapid development of new games, for new mobile devices, as well as ease of evolving with new features the {RPG}-{PLA} and custom games already in use.},

	abstract = {Software reuse enables developers to leverage past accomplishments and facilitates significant improvements in software productivity and quality. Software reuse catalyzes improvements in productivity by avoiding redevelopment and improvements in quality by incorporating components whose reliability has already been established. This study addresses a pivotal research issue that underlies software reuse - what factors characterize successful software reuse in large-scale systems. The research approach is to investigate, analyze, and evaluate software reuse empirically by mining software repositories from a {NASA} software development environment that actively reuses software. This software environment successfully follows principles of reuse-based software development in order to achieve an average reuse of 32 percent per project, which is the average amount of software either reused or modified from previous systems. We examine the repositories for 25 software systems ranging from 3,000 to 112,000 source lines from this software environment. We analyze four classes of software modules: modules reused without revision, modules reused with slight revision ({\textless}25 percent revision), modules reused with major revision (>=25 percent revision), and newly developed modules. We apply nonparametric statistical models to compare numerous development variables across the 2,954 software modules in the systems. We identify two categories of factors that characterize successful reuse-based software development of large-scale systems: module design factors and module implementation factors. We also evaluate the fault rates of the reused, modified, and newly developed modules. The module design factors that characterize module reuse without revision were (after normalization by size in source lines): few calls to other system modules, many calls to utility functions, few input-output parameters, few reads and writes, and many comments. The module implementation factors that characterize module reuse without revision were small size in source lines and (after normalization by size in source lines): low development effort and many assignment statements. The modules reused without revision had the fewest faults, fewest faults per source line, and lowest fault correction effor- t. The modules reused with major revision had the highest fault correction effort and highest fault isolation effort as wed as the most changes, most changes per source line, and highest change correction effort. In conclusion, we outline future research directions that build on these software reuse ideas and strategies.},
