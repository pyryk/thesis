%\chapter{Web Applications}
%\label{chapter:environment}

%Describe HTML5, JS and other related technology, because these are really the things that restrict the implementation.

% This could be entirely about web tech for maps? About 5 pages long.

%Maybe drop this chapter, or merge a short version of it to implementation

%Visualizations need to be implemented using web technology, because it is crucial for distributability and discoverability that the system works in web browsers...

%\section{Geographic Visualization on the Web}

%Probably should describe the relevant web technology, some needed HTML5/JS features etc.
