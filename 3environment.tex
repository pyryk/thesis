\chapter{Environment}
\label{chapter:environment}

% This could be entirely about web tech for maps? About 5 pages long.

\fixme{Maybe drop this chapter, or merge a short version of it to implementation}

\section{Web Applications}

Describe HTML5, JS and other related technology, because these are really the things that restrict the implementation.

Visualizations need to be implemented using web technology, because it is crucial for distributability and discoverability that the system works in web browsers... \fixme{continue...}

\section{Geographic Visualization on the Web}

Probably should describe the relevant web technology, some needed HTML5/JS features etc. \fixme{to subsection of related webtech?}

\section{Current State of Building Map Visualizations on the Web} % TODO come up with a better title

Describe the current libraries, frameworks and procedures used to build map visualizations on the web. Should these be evaluated separately? Use FindBooze, Peruskartta and Ottoapp as examples. Also, reason why it is unnecessarily laborious to write map visualizations every time from scratch.
